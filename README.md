# SVM
In this repository, we applied an SVM classifier to the diabetes dataset. I used different kernels and grid search to find the model with the best performance. Further explanations on implementation are available in the notebook.


###### dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict, based on diagnostic measurements, whether a patient has diabetes.
